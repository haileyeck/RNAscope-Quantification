# RNAscope-Quantification

The code in this repository is the beginnings of a RNAscope quantification automation project. The protocol is based on a protocol originally designed by graduate students Rahul Suresh and Xinzhu Tan from Dr. Yang Zhou's lab at the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University. 

There is a folder called "NSCI-420-Project" which contains the code and raw data described in Hailey Eckersberg's NSCI 420 final paper.
